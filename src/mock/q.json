Her rule was the second-longest of any British king or queen, and happened at the same time as Britain's greatest period of world power and industrial development. In 1840 she married her cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. They had nine children. After Albert's death Victoria took no further part in public affairs, but was persuaded to return by her prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, who gained for her the title Empress of India. She is often remembered as a bad-tempered old woman. However in her early life she was a happy and enthusiastic queen who was very popular with ordinary people.",
